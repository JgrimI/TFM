# TFM: AI for the Space Sector: Desarrollo de Modelos de ML para la Detección de Cambios Ecológicos
Deforestation in high-biodiversity regions, such as the Amazon rainforest, poses a critical environmental threat, impacting biodiversity, climate, and natural resource sustainability. Between 1990 and 2020, approximately 420 million hectares of tropical forest have been lost, contributing significantly to climate change by releasing stored carbon and reducing CO₂ absorption capacity. Traditional monitoring methods, such as manual satellite image analysis and field inspections, are limited by high costs, logistical challenges, and the vast scale of affected areas.
This project aims to develop deep learning models to accurately and efficiently detect deforestation using Sentinel-2 satellite data and Big Data techniques to enhance ecosystem monitoring. It is worth mentioning that this work is independent of prior research by the advisor or student, who also lacked prior experience with satellite data, necessitating an additional research phase to gain familiarity with this domain.
The methodology involved satellite data acquisition and preprocessing, the implementation of three convolutional neural network models (U-Net, Attention U-Net, and FCN), and a performance evaluation based on accuracy, IoU, and F1 Score metrics. Results demonstrated that the U-Net model without data augmentation achieved the best balance between precision and sensitivity, reaching an accuracy of 97.98% and an F1 Score of 0.9798, closely followed by the FCN model, which also exhibited competitive performance.
This study highlights the potential of deep learning for large-scale environmental monitoring, providing a scalable and accurate solution for deforestation detection. These findings lay a solid foundation for future work, including hyperparameter optimization, multispectral data usage, and model validation in other regions to evaluate global applicability across diverse ecological contexts.
